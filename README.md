Metior
======

Metior is a source code history analyzer API that provides various statistics
about a source code repository and its change over time.

Currently Metior provides basic support for Git repositories.

If you're interested in Metior, feel free to join the discussion on Convore in
[Metior's group](https://convore.com/metior).

## Examples

### One-liner for some basic statistics

    Metior.simple_stats :git, '~/open-source/metior'
    Metior.simple_stats :github, 'koraktor', 'metior'

### Create a repository object for different VCSs

    repo = Metior::Git::Repository.new '~/open-source/metior'
    repo = Metior::GitHub::Repository.new 'koraktor', 'metior'

### More fine-grained access to repository statistics

    repo.commits 'development'         # Get all commits in development
    repo.file_stats                    # Basic statistics about the files
                                       # contained in a repository
    repo.line_history                  # Quick access to lines added and
                                       # removed in each commit
    repo.significant_authors           # Get up to 3 of the most important
                                       # authors
    repo.significant_commits, 20       # Get up to 20 of the commits changing
                                       # the most lines
    repo.top_authors 'master', 5       # Get the top 5 authors in master

### Get statistics about a set of commits

    Metior::Commit.activity repo.commits
    Metior::Commit.activity repo.authors[author_id].commits
    
## Github Invocation
    repo = Metior::GitHub::Repository.new("amanelis", "3-way-handshake")
    repo.commits
    repo.authors

## Advanced usage

### Specifying commit ranges

Sometimes it's more useful to not analyze the whole history of a repository's
branch. For example when analyzing the changes from one branch to another, or
from the last released version to the latest code. In that case you will have
to specify a commit range. Specifying a commit range works just like in Git:

    'master..development'
    'master'..'development'
    'master..HEAD'
    'master'..'HEAD'
    'deadbeef..HEAD'

Given that your currently checked out branch is `development` and `master`
points to commit `deadbeef`, the above statements are equal. Please also note
the different syntaxes: The first, third and fifth example are standards string
which will be parsed by Metior. The second and fourth example are Ruby `Range`
objects which can be used by Metior right away.

## Requirements

* Grit — a Ruby API for Git
  * [Git](http://git-scm.com) >= 1.6
* Octokit — a Ruby wrapper for the GitHub API

## Documentation

The documentation of the Ruby API can be seen at [RubyDoc.info][1]. The API
documentation of the current development version is also available [there][5].

## Future plans

* More statistics and analyses
* Generation of reports in HTML or other formats
* Support for creating graphs
* Console and web application to accompany this API
* More supported VCSs, like Subversion or Mercurial
* Code analysis to show programming languages, effective lines of code, etc.

## Contribute

Metior is a open-source project. Therefore you are free to help improving it.
There are several ways of contributing to Metior's development:

* Build apps using it and spread the word.
* Report problems and request features using the [issue tracker][2].
* Write patches yourself to fix bugs and implement new functionality.
* Create a Metior fork on [GitHub][1] and start hacking. Extra points for using
  Metior pull requests and feature branches.

## About the name

The latin word "metior" means "I measure". That's just what Metior does –
measuring source code histories.
